# K-Means-Clustering-on-PCA-performed-data
In this project, you can see that I try to reduce the data dimensions using PCA, a popular approach. After this, I cluster
the data using an unsupervised ML algorithm, namely K-means clustering. The results are really nice. But so is the dataset. I recommend going after 
more complex datasets to get practical results. But this was my first project with K-means clustering and so, I have
included this here. The codes have been written using R. The project is well-documented.
